			EnderUNIX VoIPong 
		VoIP call detector and voice dumper 

		VoIPong is a utility which detects all Voice Over IP calls
	on a pipeline, and for those which are G711 encoded, dumps actual
	conversation to separate wave files. It supports SIP, H323, Cisco's
	Skinny Client Protocol, RTP and RTCP.

		It's been written in C language for performance reasons, proved
	to be running on Solaris, Linux and FreeBSD; though it's thought to compile
	and run on other platforms as well.

		It's multi-algoritm framework enables users with the ability to
	suit the best packet matching algorithm for their environment.

		On a 45 Mbit/sec actual network traffic, it's been verified
	that VoIPong successfully detected all VoIP gateways and the VoIP calls. 
	CPU utilization during the run has been found ranging between 66% - 80%
	on a 256MB RAM, Celeron 1700 Mhz Toshiba notebook.

		With it's dynamic framework for coding 3rd party voice codecs,
	the current decoding capability can be easily extended.

	VoIPong has been awarded the first standing by IBM Turkiye in its Linux Awards
	2004 competition.
